MapGenerator:

    executable file:

	mainwindow.rb

- this creates two files map_#####.tbm (tea's bitmap - a file that simply containing the elevations in number format) 
and the map_#####.bmp which obviously is a bitmap.  The ##### is the seed number of the map.

- if you wish to change the size of the map go into mainwindow.rb and edit $MapRows.

- the .tbm file can be copied over to Exploration and renamed to map.tbm and Exploration will load that map using tiles that I have borrowed from
Crossfire RPG (an open source game) and this will allow you to explore the map as though it was in a game.
